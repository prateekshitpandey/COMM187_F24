    "\n",
    "**Interpreted:** Some programming languages are compiled, and some are interpreted. The difference is not too complicated, and you can read more about it [here](https://kb.iu.edu/d/agsz), but we won't get into that. Put simply, interpreted languages are simple, human-readable, and are executed one statement at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Object-oriented:** It means that everything in Python is an \"object\". In object-oriented programming, data and its related functions are combined into cohesive units called “objects.” If that doesn't sound intuitively helpful or easy to understand right now, don't worry, it will make sense as you start coding more. if you are curious, you can read about it [here](https://medium.com/@Adekola_Olawale/beginners-guide-to-object-oriented-programming-a94601ea2fbd#0ff9).\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-level:** As compard to \"low-level\" languages like assembly language which are directly interpretable by the computer processors, and are not readable by humans. High-level languages are easy for humans to understand and read."

On Jupyter, you can write code and execute its output right underneath it. More importantly, Jupyter can be hosted on a server, which means that the code runs on the server and not your computer.
