    "One of the most important things we do with programming is visualizing data. \n",
    "Data visualization allows us to: \n",
    "- communicate what we have found with a larger audiance\n",
    "- inspect patterns and trends in our data \n",
    "- identify outliers in our data \n",
    "- compare variables \n",
    "\n",
    "In python we use the library  `matplotlib`. `matplotlib` in Python is a fundamental skill for anyone interested in data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is an integral part of the scientific Python ecosystem, and it is used for visualization. It is an extension of NumPy. It provides a Matlab-like interface for plotting and visualization. It was originally developed by John D. Hunter as an open source alternative usable with Python (Pajankar, 2021). You can read more about mat plot lib here: https://matplotlib.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of creating a graphic in Python as being much like painting. You start with an empty canvas. Every time you use a graphics function, it adds new elements to your canvas (another apt anology might be transparencies that were used with projectors in the 90s). Later on, you can add more elements on top of your initial plot if you want.\n",
