    "The dataset for this week's assignment is about the concept of redlining in the US. Redlining is the discriminatory practice of denying services (like mortgages) to residents of certain areas based on racial or ethnic composition, leading to economic and social disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is stored as a csv file in the sub-folder \"data\" by the name \"metro-grades.csv\". \\\n",
    "You can read more about the dataset on its [github repository page](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/redlining). I have copied relevant information about the dataset below:\n",
    "\n",
    "This csv file contains 2020 population total estimates by race/ethnicity for combined zones of each redlining grade (from Home Owners' Loan Corporation \\[HOLC\\] maps originally drawn in 1935-40, downloaded from the [Mapping Inequality project](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/37.8/-97.9&maps=0)) within micro- and metropolitan areas. Also included are population estimates in the surrounding area of each metropolitan area's HOLC map (computed by adding a 10 percent buffer radius to the minimum bounding circle of all zones in that metro area) and [location quotients](https://belonging.berkeley.edu/technical-appendix#footnote34_cnxakh3) (LQs) for each racial/ethnic group and HOLC grade. LQs are small-area measures of segregation that specifically compare one racial/ethnic group’s proportion in a granular geography to their proportion in a larger surrounding geography. An LQ above 1 for a given racial group indicates overrepresentation in that HOLC zone relative to the broader surrounding area, and values below 1 indicate underrepresentation. Only micro- and metropolitan areas with both A- (“best”) and D-rated (“hazardous”) zones in their redlining map are included — 138 of a total 143 metropolitan areas in the data from Mapping Inequality.\n",
