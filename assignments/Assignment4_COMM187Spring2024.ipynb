    "**Data:** For one pair of individuals in the study sample, the variables provided contain data about texts between these individuals that have been collected over a period of about three months. The data is stored in these variables in the order in which they were sent. We have data on the day of the month, name of the month, time of the day, time of day it was sent, and the associated emotional tone:\n",
    "\n",
    "`message_id` is a numpy array with unique identification id's of the text message. This helps anonymize the data and protect the privacy of the study participants. \\\n",
    "`day` is a numpy array with the day of the month. \\\n",
    "`month` is a numpy array with the name of the month. \\\n",
    "`time` is a numpy array with the time of the day. \\\n",
    "`tone` is a numpy array with the emotional tone of the texts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these arrays has a special relationship called a **\"parallel structure.\"** This means that the data in each array at a particular index corresponds to the same single text message. For example, the first element in each array refers to the first message, the second element to the second message, and so on. This is important for analyzing the data accurately because it ensures you are looking at the right elements across different arrays that relate to the same text message.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\\\n",
    "`message_id[0]` contains the unique ID for the first text message. \\\n",
    "Similarly, `day[0]`, `month[0]`, `time[0]`, and `tone[0]` provide the day of the month, the name of the month, the time of the day, and the emotional tone of that same first message.\n",
    "\n",
    "***How to use this structure in your analysis:***\n",
    " - By using the `message_id` as a reference, you can ensure that you are consistently analyzing data from the same message when comparing across the `day`, `month`, `time`, and `tone` arrays.\n",
    " - This structured approach allows you to effectively maintain data integrity and privacy while performing data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this structure is crucial for performing correct analysis. As you work through the assignment, you will use indexing to navigate through these arrays. This will involve extracting and comparing data across `day`, `month`, `time`, and `tone` to analyze communication patterns and emotional tones based on the timing of the messages.\n",
